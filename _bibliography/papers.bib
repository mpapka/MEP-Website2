  abstract={In a complete theory there is an element corresponding to each element of reality. A sufficient condition for the reality of a physical quantity is the possibility of predicting it with certainty, without disturbing the system. In quantum mechanics in the case of two physical quantities described by non-commuting operators, the knowledge of one precludes the knowledge of the other. Then either (1) the description of reality given by the wave function in quantum mechanics is not complete or (2) these two quantities cannot have simultaneous reality. Consideration of the problem of making predictions concerning a system on the basis of measurements made on another system that had previously interacted with it leads to the result that if (1) is false then (2) is also false. One is thus led to conclude that the description of reality as given by a wave function is not complete.},

 abstract = {The National Fusion Collaboratory focuses on enabling fusion scientists to explore Grid capabilities in support of experimental science. Fusion experiments are structured as a series of plasma pulses initiated roughly every 20 minutes. In the between-pulse intervals scientists perform data analysis and discuss results to reach decisions affecting changes to the next plasma pulse. This interaction can be made more efficient by performing more analysis and engaging more expertise from a geographically distributed team of scientists and resources. In this paper, we describe a virtual control room experiment that unites collaborative, visualization, and Grid technologies to provide such environment and shows how their combined effect can advance experimental science. We also report on FusionGrid services whose use during the fusion experimental cycle became possible for the first time thanks to this technology. We also describe the Access Grid, experimental data presentation tools, and agreement-based resource management and workflow systems enabling time-bounded end-to-end application execution. The first virtual control room experiment represented a mock-up of a remote interaction with the DIII-D control room and was presented at SC03 and later reviewed at an international ITER Grid Workshop.},

In particular, the project is developing and deploying a national Fusion Energy Sciences Grid (FusionGrid) that is a system for secure sharing of computation, visualization, and data resources over the Internet. The FusionGrid goal is to allow scientists at remote sites to fully participate in experimental and computational activities as if they were working at a common site thereby creating a virtual organization of the US fusion community.

 abstract = {Immersive projection displays have played an important role in enabling large-format virtual reality systems such as the CAVE and CAVE like devices and the various immersive desks and desktop-like displays. However, these devices have played a minor role so far in advancing the sense of immersion for conferencing systems. The Access Grid project led by Argonne is exploring the use of large-scale projection based systems as the basis for building room oriented collaboration and semi-immersive visualization systems. The authors believe these multi-projector systems will become common infrastructure in the future, largely based on their value for enabling group-to-group collaboration in an environment that can also support large-format projector based visualization. Creating a strong sense of immersion is an important goal for future collaboration technologies. Immersion in conferencing applications implies that the users can rely on natural sight and audio cues to facilitate interactions with participants at remote sites. The Access Grid is a low cost environment aimed primarily at supporting conferencing applications, but it also enables semi-immersive visualization and in particular, remote visualization. In this paper, they describe the current state of the Access Grid project and how it relates and compares to other environments. They also discuss augmentations to the Access Grid that will enable it to support more immersive visualizations. These enhancements include stereo, higher performance rendering support, tracking and non-uniform projection surface.},

 abstract = {To better understand the vortex dynamics of coherent structures in turbulent and transitional boundary layers, we consider direct numerical simulation of the interaction between a flat-plateboundary-layer flow and an isolated hemispherical roughness element. Of principal interest is the evolution of hairpin vortices that form an interlacing pattern in the wake of the hemisphere, lift away from the wall, and are stretched by the shearing action of the boundary layer. Using animations of unsteady three-dimensional representations of this flow, produced by the vtk toolkit and enhanced to operate in a CAVE virtual environment, we identify and study several key features in the evolution of this complex vortex topology not previously observed in other visualization formats.},

The I-WAY is an experimental environment for building distributed virtual reality applications and for exploring issues of distrib uted wide-area resource management and scheduling. The goal of the I-WAY project is to enable researchers to use multiple internetworked supercomputers and ad vanced visualization systems to conduct very large scale computations. By connecting 12 ATM testbeds, 17 supercomputer centers, 5 virtual reality research sites, and over 60 applications groups, the I-WAY project has created an extremely diverse wide-area environment for exploring advanced applications. This environment has provided a glimpse of the future for advanced scientific and engineering computing.},

@inproceedings{CaDiPa96,
 abstract = {Virtual prototyping involves a synthesis of engineering methodology and immersive, three-dimensional visualization technology. Ideally, this is a process in which computational models are used in place of physical models in the development of a new product or design concept. If used successfully, virtual prototyping can lead to more rapid product design and development. Software is currently being developed that will enable virtual prototyping of mechanical systems in the CAVE (CAVE Automatic Virtual Environment) at Argonne National Laboratory. This software has two principal components: (1) fast simulation software, FIFEA (Fast Implicit Finite Element Analysis), for analyzing mechanical systems and (2) virtual reality display software for visualizing results and allowing user interaction. This paper discusses various issues related to the coupling of finite element software to the CAVE display system.},
