abstract = {Stereoscopic 360¬∞ panoramas are a popular modality for creating cinematic virtual reality experiences. However, media in this format are typically static entities that consumers passively view. This is because objects visible in the scene, and camera properties such as depth of field, must be determined at capture time. We propose a real-time technique for dynamically synthesizing stereoscopic 360¬∞ panoramas from a collection of depth enhanced monoscopic panoramas. Using depth information, pixels can be transformed into three-dimensional space and re-projected to a different camera location. Our technique allows for head-motion parallax, dynamic depth of field, and integration of properly occluded virtual objects into the captured scene. Our technique shows minimal discrepancies compared to ground truth captures and reduces error when compared to existing stereoscopic 360¬∞ panoramic synthesis techniques. Additionally, our technique makes creating interactive extended reality experiences more accessible since monoscopic 360¬∞ cameras are much more common than their stereoscopic counterparts.},

EVL's introduction of the CAVE Automatic Virtual Environment in 1992, the first widely replicated, projection-based, walk-in, virtual reality (VR) system in the world, put EVL at the forefront of collaborative, immersive data exploration and analytics. However, the journey did not begin then. Since its founding in 1973, EVL has been developing tools and techniques for real-time, interactive visualizations‚Äîpillars of VR. But EVL's culture is also relevant to its successes, as it has always been an interdisciplinary lab that fosters teamwork, where each person's expertise contributes to the development of the necessary tools, hardware, system software, applications, and human interface models to solve problems. Over the years, as multidisciplinary collaborations evolved and advanced scientific instruments and data resources were distributed globally, the need to access and share data and visualizations while working with colleagues, local and remote, synchronous and asynchronous, also became important fields of study. This paper is a retrospective of EVL's past 50 years that surveys the many networked, immersive, collaborative visualization and VR systems and applications it developed and deployed, as well as lessons learned and future plans.}",

  abstract = {We seek to transform how new and emergent variants of pandemic-causing viruses, specifically SARS-CoV-2, are identified and classified. By adapting large language models (LLMs) for genomic data, we build genome-scale language models (GenSLMs) which can learn the evolutionary landscape of SARS-CoV-2 genomes. By pre-training on over 110 million prokaryotic gene sequences and fine-tuning a SARS-CoV-2-specific model on 1.5 million genomes, we show that GenSLMs can accurately and rapidly identify variants of concern. Thus, to our knowledge, GenSLMs represents one of the first whole-genome scale foundation models which can generalize to other prediction tasks. We demonstrate scaling of GenSLMs on GPU-based supercomputers and AI-hardware accelerators utilizing 1.63 Zettaflops in training runs with a sustained performance of 121 PFLOPS in mixed precision and peak of 850 PFLOPS. We present initial scientific insights from examining GenSLMs in tracking evolutionary dynamics of SARS-CoV-2, paving the path to realizing this on large biological data.}

  abstract = {In the realm of Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD), the demand for memory and computation resources is extreme, necessitating the use of leadership-scale computing platforms for practical domain sizes. This intensive requirement renders traditional checkpointing methods ineffective due to the significant slowdown in simulations while saving state data to disk. As we progress towards exascale and GPU-driven High-Performance Computing (HPC) and confront larger problem sizes, the choice becomes increasingly stark: to compromise data fidelity or to reduce resolution. To navigate this challenge, this study advocates for the use of in situ analysis and visualization techniques. These allow more frequent data "snapshots" to be taken directly from memory, thus avoiding the need for disruptive checkpointing. We detail our approach of instrumenting NekRS, a GPU-focused thermal-fluid simulation code employing the spectral element method (SEM), and describe varied in situ and in transit strategies for data rendering. Additionally, we provide concrete scientific use-cases and report on runs performed on Polaris, Argonne Leadership Computing Facility‚Äôs (ALCF) 44 Petaflop supercomputer and J\"{u}lich Wizard for European Leadership Science (JUWELS) Booster, J\"{u}lich Supercomputing Centre‚Äôs (JSC) 71 Petaflop High Performance Computing (HPC) system, offering practical insight into the implications of our methodology.},

However, implementing a temporal cache for large-scale simulations can be challenging. Implicit neural networks have proven effective in compressing large volume data. However, their application to distributed data has yet to be fully explored. In this work, we develop an implicit neural representation for distributed volume data and incorporate it into the DIVA reactive programming system. This implementation enables us to build an in situ temporal caching system with a capacity 100 times larger than previously achieved. We integrate our implementation into the Ascent infrastructure and evaluate its performance using real-world simulations.},

 abstract = {Artificial intelligence (AI) methods have become critical in scientific applications to help accelerate scientific discovery. Large language models (LLMs) are being considered as a promising approach to address some of the challenging problems because of their superior generalization capabilities across domains. The effectiveness of the models and the accuracy of the applications is contingent upon their efficient execution on the underlying hardware infrastructure. Specialized AI accelerator hardware systems have recently become available for accelerating AI applications. However, the comparative performance of these AI accelerators on large language models has not been previously studied. In this paper, we systematically study LLMs on multiple AI accelerators and GPUs and evaluate their performance characteristics for these models. We evaluate these systems with (i) a micro-benchmark using a core transformer block, (ii) a GPT- 2 model, and (iii) an LLM-driven science use case, GenSLM. We present our findings and analyses of the models' performance to better understand the intrinsic capabilities of AI accelerators. Furthermore, our analysis takes into account key factors such as sequence lengths, scaling behavior, sparsity, and sensitivity to gradient accumulation steps.},

The growing complexity and scale of these systems demand an increase in monitoring data collected at multiple fidelity levels and varying temporal resolutions. In this work, we aim to build a holistic analytical system that helps make sense of such massive data, mainly the hardware logs, job logs, and environment logs collected from disparate subsystems and components of a supercomputer system. This end-to-end log analysis system, coupled with visual analytics support, allows users to glean and promptly extract supercomputer usage and error patterns at varying temporal and spatial resolutions. We use multiresolution dynamic mode decomposition (mrDMD), a technique that depicts high-dimensional data as correlated spatial-temporal variations patterns or modes, to extract variation patterns isolated at specified frequencies. Our improvements to the mrDMD algorithm help promptly reveal useful information in the massive environment log dataset, which is then associated with the processed hardware and job log datasets using our visual analytics system. Furthermore, our system can identify the usage and error patterns filtered at user, project, and subcomponent levels. We exemplify the effectiveness of our approach with two use scenarios with the Cray XC40 supercomputer.},

Data portals are commonly used to organize, publish, and securely disseminate data‚Äîa critical step toward making data findable, accessible, interoperable, and reusable (FAIR). However, the diversity of scientific data types, sizes, and their location present significant challenges, e.g., it is difficult for portals to accommodate heterogenous research products when using strict metadata schemas and rigid interfaces. Thus, there is a need for a user-customizable data portal solution that enables rapid creation of new portals that may be tailored to a researchers needs while accommodating distributed data sources and engaging advanced computing resources.

 abstract = {Supercomputer scheduling policies commonly result in many transient idle nodes, a phenomenon that is only partially alleviated by backfill scheduling methods that promote small jobs to run before large jobs. Here we describe how to realize a novel use for these otherwise wasted resources, namely, deep neural network (DNN) training. This important workload is easily organized as many small fragments that can be configured dynamically to fit essentially any node √ó time hole in a supercomputer's schedule. We describe how the task of rescaling suitable DNN training tasks to fit dynamically changing holes can be formulated as a deterministic mixed integer linear programming (MILP)-based resource allocation algorithm, and show that this MILP problem can be solved efficiently at run time. We show further how this MILP problem can be adapted to optimize for administrator- or user-defined metrics. We validate our method with supercomputer scheduler logs and different DNN training scenarios, and demonstrate efficiencies of up to 93\% compared with running the same training tasks on dedicated nodes. Our method thus enables substantial supercomputer resources to be allocated to DNN training with no impact on other applications.},

 abstract = {Reinforcement learning (RL) is exploited for cluster scheduling in the field of high-performance computing (HPC). One of the key challenges for RL driven scheduling is state representation for RL agent (i.e., capturing essential features of dynamic scheduling environment for decision making). Existing state encoding approaches either lack critical scheduling information or suffer from poor scalability. In this study, we present SEM (Scalable and Efficient encoding Model) for general RL driven scheduling in HPC. It captures system resource and waiting job state, both being critical information for scheduling. It encodes these pieces of information into a fixed-sized vector as an input to the agent. A typical agent is built on deep neural network, and its training/inference cost grows exponentially with the size of its input. Production HPC systems contain a large number of computer nodes. As such, a direct encoding of each of the system resources would lead to poor scalability of the RL agent. SEM uses two techniques to transform the system resource state into a small-sized vector, hence being capable of representing a large number of system resources in a vector of 100--200. Our trace-based simulations demonstrate that compared to the existing state encoding methods, SEM can achieve 9X training speedup and 6X inference speedup while maintaining comparable scheduling performance.},

Moreover, ChemoGraph highlights interactive features that support users in viewing, comparing, and organizing computationally identified related chemicals.

 abstract = {We seek to transform how new and emergent variants of pandemiccausing viruses, specifically SARS-CoV-2, are identified and classified. By adapting large language models (LLMs) for genomic data, we build genome-scale language models (GenSLMs) which can learn the evolutionary landscape of SARS-CoV-2 genomes. By pretraining on over 110 million prokaryotic gene sequences and finetuning a SARS-CoV-2-specific model on 1.5 million genomes, we show that GenSLMs can accurately and rapidly identify variants of concern. Thus, to our knowledge, GenSLMs represents one of the first whole genome scale foundation models which can generalize to other prediction tasks. We demonstrate scaling of GenSLMs on GPU-based supercomputers and AI-hardware accelerators utilizing 1.63 Zettaflops in training runs with a sustained performance of 121 PFLOPS in mixed precision and peak of 850 PFLOPS. We present initial scientific insights from examining GenSLMs in tracking evolutionary dynamics of SARS-CoV-2, paving the path to realizing this on large biological data.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.},

Online analysis methods are needed to enable the collection of only interesting subsets of such massive data streams, such as by explicitly discarding some data elements or by directing instruments to relevant areas of experimental space. Thus, methods are required for configuring and running distributed computing pipelines‚Äîwhat we call flows‚Äîthat link instruments, computers (e.g., for analysis, simulation, artificial intelligence [AI] model training), edge computing (e.g., for analysis), data stores, metadata catalogs, and high-speed networks. We review common patterns associated with such flows and describe methods for instantiating these patterns. We present experiences with the application of these methods to the processing of data from five different scientific instruments, each of which engages powerful computers for data inversion,model training, or other purposes. We also discuss implications of such methods for operators and users of scientific facilities.},

 abstract = {Virtual reality offers unique affordances that can benefit the scientific discovery process. However, virtual reality applications must maintain very high frame rates to provide immersion and prevent adverse events such as visual fatigue and motion sickness. Maintaining high frame rates can be challenging when visualizing scientific data that is large in scale. One successful technique for enabling interactive exploration of large-scale datasets is to create a large image collection from a structured sampling of camera positions, time steps, and visualization operators. This paper highlights our work to adapt this technique for virtual reality, and uses two authentic scientific datasets -- a) a large-scale simulation of cancer cell transport and capture in a microfluidic device and b) a large-scale molecular dynamics simulation of graphene for creating extremely low friction interactions. We create a collection of omnidirectional stereoscopic images (three-dimensional surround-view panoramas), each of which captures all possible view angles from a given location. Therefore, virtual reality devices can always render local movements at full frame rates without loading a new image from the collection.},

The state-of-the-art in the evaluation of deep learning workloads primarily focuses on CPUs and GPUs.

 abstract = {Color encoding is foundational to visualizing quantitative data. Guidelines for colormap design have traditionally emphasized perceptual principles, such as order and uniformity. However, colors also evoke cognitive and linguistic associations whose role in data interpretation remains underexplored. We study how two linguistic factors, name salience and name variation, affect people's ability to draw inferences from spatial visualizations. In two experiments, we found that participants are better at interpreting visualizations when viewing colors with more salient names (e.g., prototypical ‚Äòblue‚Äô, ‚Äòyellow‚Äô, and ‚Äòred‚Äô over ‚Äòteal‚Äô, ‚Äòbeige‚Äô, and ‚Äòmaroon‚Äô). The effect was robust across four visualization types, but was more pronounced in continuous (e.g., smooth geographical maps) than in similar discrete representations (e.g., choropleths). Participants' accuracy also improved as the number of nameable colors increased, although the latter had a less robust effect. Our findings suggest that color nameability is an important design consideration for quantitative colormaps, and may even outweigh traditional perceptual metrics. In particular, we found that the linguistic associations of color are a better predictor of performance than the perceptual properties of those colors. We discuss the implications and outline research opportunities. The data and materials for this study are available at https://osf.io/asb7n},

@article{MaPa21,
 abstract = {Surround-view panoramic images and videos have become a popular form of media for interactive viewing on mobile devices and virtual reality headsets. Viewing such media provides a sense of immersion by allowing users to control their view direction and experience an entire environment. When using a virtual reality headset, the level of immersion can be improved by leveraging stereoscopic capabilities. Stereoscopic images are generated in pairs, one for the left eye and one for the right eye, and result in providing an important depth cue for the human visual system. For computer generated imagery, rendering proper stereo pairs is well known for a fixed view. However, it is much more difficult to create omnidirectional stereo pairs for a surround-view projection that work well when looking in any direction. One major drawback of traditional omnidirectional stereo images is that they suffer from binocular misalignment in the peripheral vision as a user's view direction approaches the zenith / nadir (north / south pole) of the projection sphere. This paper presents a real-time geometry-based approach for omnidirectional stereo rendering that fits into the standard rendering pipeline. Our approach includes tunable parameters that enable pole merging - a reduction in the stereo effect near the poles that can minimize binocular misalignment. Results from a user study indicate that pole merging reduces visual fatigue and discomfort associated with binocular misalignment without inhibiting depth perception.},

 abstract = {The ordering of data can reveal patterns in various data visualizations. It significantly affects the expressiveness of visualizations by making them clear or cluttered. Clutter makes it hard for users to perceive patterns, even for a small dataset. Almost all visualization tools available today support ordering through indirect manipulation techniques where users rely on a widget (e.g., a button or a checkbox) to perform ordering in some predefined way. For example, using widgets for sorting a selected subset of data involves creating widgets to filter the data, highlight the filtered data, and then apply the ordering. This work presents a new interaction technique based on direct manipulation, which supports flexible visual ordering. This direct manipulation-based interaction helps to visually filter the data and then order them. We demonstrate how the proposed interaction technique works with bar charts and matrices, two heavily used visualization techniques that involve ordering.},

 abstract = {Color mapping is a commonly used technique for visualizing scalar fields. While there exists advice for choosing effective colormaps, it is unclear if current guidelines apply equally across task types. We study the perception of gradients and evaluate the effectiveness of three colormaps at depicting gradient magnitudes. In a crowd-sourced experiment, we determine the just-noticeable differences (JNDs) at which participants can reliably compare and judge variations in gradient between two scalar fields. We find that participants exhibited lower JNDs with a diverging (cool-warm) or a spectral (rainbow) scheme, as compared with a monotonic-luminance colormap (viridis). The results support a hypothesis that apparent discontinuities in the color ramp may help viewers discern subtle structural differences in gradient. We discuss these findings and highlight future research directions for colormap evaluation.},

 abstract = {We describe a cloud-based medical image reconstruction service designed to meet a real-time and daily demand to reconstruct thousands of images from proton cancer treatment facilities worldwide. Rapid reconstruction of a three-dimensional Proton Computed Tomography (pCT) image can require the transfer of 100\&amp;\#x00A0;GB of data and use of approximately 120 GPU-enabled compute nodes. The nature of proton therapy means that demand for such a service is sporadic and comes from potentially hundreds of clients worldwide. We thus explore the use of a commercial cloud as a scalable and cost-efficient platform for pCT reconstruction. To address the high performance requirements of this application we leverage Amazon Web Services\&amp;\#x2019; GPU-enabled cluster resources that are provisioned with high performance networks between nodes. To support episodic demand, we develop an on-demand multi-user provisioning service that can dynamically provision and resize clusters based on image reconstruction requirements, priorities, and wait times. We compare the performance of our pCT reconstruction service running on commercial cloud resources with that of the same application on dedicated local high performance computing resources. We show that we can achieve scalable and on-demand reconstruction of large scale pCT images for simultaneous multi-client requests, processing images in less than 10 minutes for less than $10 per image.},

In situ analysis, which can be simultaneously executed with the simulation, mitigates I/O bottlenecks and can accelerate discovery of new phenomena. However, in typical modes of operation, this requires either stalling simulation during analysis phase or transferring data for analysis. We study the scalability challenges of time- and space-shared modes of analyzing large-scale molecular dynamics simulations. We also propose topology-aware mapping for simulation and analysis.

 abstract = {We present a system for interactive in situ visualization of large particle simulations, suitable for general CPU-based HPC architectures. As simulations grow in scale, in situ methods are needed to alleviate IO bottlenecks and visualize data at full spatio-temporal resolution. We use a lightweight loosely-coupled layer serving distributed data from the simulation to a data-parallel renderer running in separate processes. Leveraging the OSPRay ray tracing framework for visualization and balanced P-k-d trees, we can render simulation data in real-time, as they arrive, with negligible memory overhead. This flexible solution allows users to perform exploratory in situ visualization on the same computational resources as the simulation code, on dedicated visualization clusters or remote workstations, via a standalone rendering client that can be connected or disconnected as needed. We evaluate this system on simulations with up to 227M particles in the LAMMPS and Uintah computational frameworks, and show that our approach provides many of the advantages of tightly-coupled systems, with the flexibility to render on a wide variety of remote and coprocessing resources.\&amp;lt;br /\&amp;gt;\&amp;lt;br /\&amp;gt;},

 abstract = {Scalability and time-to-solution studies have historically been focused on the size of the problem and run time. We consider a more strict definition of "solution" whereby a live data analysis (co-visualization of either the full data or in situ data extracts) provides continuous and reconfigurable insight into massively parallel simulations. Specifically, we used the Argonne Leadership Class Facility's (ALCF) BlueGene/P machine with 163,840 cores tightly linked through a high-speed network to 100 visualization nodes that share 800 cores and 200 GPUs. Three meshes with respectively 52M, 416M and 3.3B elements discretize the flow over a full swept wing with an unsteady synthetic jet to evaluate time-to-solution plus insight. On the full machine, the 416M element mesh takes about 2 seconds per flow solve step including the extraction and rendering of a slice or a contour, slowing currently the simulation by only 10 and 15\% respectively. The 3.3B element case proved scalable at about 15 seconds per time step, whereas PHASTA's strong scaling could compress the time-to-solution for the 52M element case enough to allow the rendering of one frame (slice or contour) every 0.7 second, paving the way for interactive simulation and simulation steering on massively parallel systems1.},

 abstract = {One of the most pressing issues with petascale analysis is the transport of simulation results data to a meaningful analysis. Traditional workflow prescribes storing the simulation results to disk and later retrieving them for analysis and visualization. However, at petascale this storage of the full results is prohibitive. A solution to this problem is to run the analysis and visualization concurrently with the simulation and bypass the storage of the full results. One mechanism for doing so is in transit visualization in which analysis and visualization is run on I/O nodes that receive the full simulation results but write information from analysis or provide run-time visualization. This paper describes the work in progress for three in transit visualization solutions, each using a different transport mechanism.},

At the time of this rendering, the simulation has evolved to a redshift of 3.5. The simulation volume is 11.2 comoving megaparsecs, and has a uniform grid of 10243 cells, with over 1 billion dark matter and star particles.This animation shows a combined view of the baryon density, dark matter density, radiation energy and emissivity from this simulation. The multi-variate rendering is particularly useful because is shows both the baryonic matter ("normal") and dark matter, and the pressure and temperature variables are properties of only the baryonic matter. Visible in the gas density are "bubbles", or shells, created by the radiation feedback from young stars. Seeing the bubbles from feedback provides confirmation of the physics model implemented. Features such as these are difficult to identify algorithmically, but easily found when viewing the visualization},

 abstract = {Multi-scale modeling of arterial blood flow can shed light on the interaction between events happening at micro- and meso-scales (i.e., adhesion of red blood cells to the arterial wall, clot formation) and at macro-scales (i.e., change in flow patterns due to the clot). Coupled numerical simulations of such multi-scale flow require state-of-the-art computers and algorithms, along with techniques for multi-scale visualizations.This animation presents results of two studies used in the development of a multi-scale visualization methodology. The first illustrates a flow of healthy (red) and diseased (blue) blood cells with a Dissipative Particle Dynamics (DPD) method. Each blood cell is represented by a mesh made of 500 DPD-particles, and small spheres show a sub-set of the DPD particles representing the blood plasma, while instantaneous streamlines and slices represent the ensemble average velocity. In the second we investigate the process of thrombus (blood clot) formation, which may be responsible for the rupture of aneurysms, by concentrating on the platelet blood cells, observing as they aggregate on the wall of an aneurysm. The ability to use a single integrated tool for the visualization of this multi-scale simulation data is important to understanding the effects of the large-scale flow patterns on the detailed particle behavior.},

 abstract = {Over the last 20 years, the open-source community has provided more and more software on which the world‚Äôs high-performance computing systems depend for performance and productivity. The community has invested millions of dollars and years of effort to build key components. However, although the investments in these separate software elements have been tremendously valuable, a great deal of productivity has also been lost because of the lack of planning, coordination, and key integration of technologies necessary to make them work together smoothly and efficiently, both within individual petascale systems and between different systems. It seems clear that this completely uncoordinated development model will not provide the software needed to support the unprecedented parallelism required for peta/ exascale computation on millions of cores, or the flexibility required to exploit new hardware models and features, such as transactional memory, speculative execution, and graphics processing units. This report describes the work of the community to prepare for the challenges of exascale computing, ultimately combing their efforts in a coordinated International Exascale Software Project.},

 abstract = {Flash has been successful in simulating a wide variety of astrophysical problems, both within the flash center and in the external community. The code has steadily gained acceptance since its initial release for the following reasons: (1) it is easily ported to a variety of computer architectures and the distribution includes support for many standard machines; (2) creation of new applications is straightforward and well-documented, and the suite of tools allows users to quickly process and interpret simulation results; (3) and the modularity of the code allows users to readily add functionality. The unusually large scale of flash necessitates the adoption of practices already in wide commercial use but not typically found in an academic scientific project. The principal lesson learned during the development of flash is the importance of good software practices. These include thorough documentation, detailed design specifications for the framework and components, and especially regression testing, which is essential in a project with multiple developers.},

 abstract = {The National Fusion Collaboratory project seeks to enable fusion scientists to exploit Grid capabilities in support of experimental science. To this end we are exploring the concept of a collaborative control room that harnesses Grid and collaborative technologies to provide an environment in which remote experimental devices, codes, and expertise can interact in real time during an experiment. This concept has the potential to make fusion experiments more efficient by enabling researchers to perform more analysis and by engaging more expertise from a geographically distributed team of scientists and resources. As the realities of software development, talent distribution, and budgets increasingly encourage pooling resources and specialization, we see such environments as a necessary tool for future science.In this paper, we describe an experimental mock-up of a remote interaction with the DIII-D control room. The collaborative control room was demonstrated at SC03 and later reviewed at an international ITER Grid Workshop. We describe how the combined effect of various technologies--collaborative, visualization, and Grid--can be used effectively in experimental science. Specifically, we describe the Access Grid, experimental data presentation tools, and agreement-based resource management and workflow systems enabling time-bounded end-to-end application execution. We also report on FusionGrid services whose use during the fusion experimental cycle became possible for the first time thanks to this technology, and we discuss its potential use in future fusion experiments.},

 abstract = {We developed a testbed containing: real time data from over 830 highway traffic sensors in the Chicago region, data about weather, and text data about events that might affect traffic. The goal was to detect in real time interesting changes in traffic conditions. Given the size and complexity of the data, we choose to build a large number of separate baseline models. We built a separate baseline for each hour in the day, for each day in the week, and for every 2 or 3 traffic sensors, resulting in over 42,000 separate baseline models. We also built a baseline engine to build the necessary baselines automatically. We modified an open source scoring engine to process in real time each new sensor reading, update the appropriate feature vectors, score the updated feature vectors using the baseline models, and send out real time alerts when deviations from the baselines were detected.},

 abstract = {The National Fusion Collaboratory focuses on enabling fusion scientists to explore Grid capabilities in support of experimental science. Fusion experiments are structured as a series of plasma pulses initiated roughly every 20 minutes. In the between-pulse intervals scientists perform data analysis and discuss results to reach decisions affecting changes to the next plasma pulse. This interaction can be made more efficient by performing more analysis and engaging more expertise from a geographically distributed team of scientists and resources. In this paper, we describe a virtual control room experiment that unites collaborative, visualization, and Grid technologies to provide such environment and shows how their combined effect can advance experimental science. We also report on FusionGrid services whose use during the fusion experimental cycle became possible for the first time thanks to this technology. We also describe the Access Grid, experimental data presentation tools, and agreement-based resource management and workflow systems enabling time-bounded end-to-end application execution. The first virtual control room experiment represented a mock-up of a remote interaction with the DIII-D control room and was presented at SC03 and later reviewed at an international ITER Grid Workshop.},

 abstract = {Immersive projection displays have played an important role in enabling large-format virtual reality systems such as the CAVE and CAVE like devices and the various immersive desks and desktop-like displays. However, these devices have played a minor role so far in advancing the sense of immersion for conferencing systems. The Access Grid project led by Argonne is exploring the use of large-scale projection based systems as the basis for building room oriented collaboration and semi-immersive visualization systems. The authors believe these multi-projector systems will become common infrastructure in the future, largely based on their value for enabling group-to-group collaboration in an environment that can also support large-format projector based visualization. Creating a strong sense of immersion is an important goal for future collaboration technologies. Immersion in conferencing applications implies that the users can rely on natural sight and audio cues to facilitate interactions with participants at remote sites. The Access Grid is a low cost environment aimed primarily at supporting conferencing applications, but it also enables semi-immersive visualization and in particular, remote visualization. In this paper, they describe the current state of the Access Grid project and how it relates and compares to other environments. They also discuss augmentations to the Access Grid that will enable it to support more immersive visualizations. These enhancements include stereo, higher performance rendering support, tracking and non-uniform projection surface.},

Users can interactively request and toggle static vector fields, dynamic streamlines, and flowing vector fields. In addition, the user can interactively place injector nozzles on boiler walls and visualize massed, evaporating sprays emanating from them. Some characteristics of the spray can be adjusted from within the visualization environment including spray shape and particle size.

Of principal interest is the evolution of hairpin vortices that form an interlacing pattern in the wake of the hemisphere, lift away from the wall, and are stretched by the shearing action of the boundary layer. Using animations of unsteady three-dimensional representations of this flow, produced by the vtk toolkit and enhanced to operate in a CAVE virtual environment, we identify and study several key features in the evolution of this complex vortex topology not previously observed in other visualization formats.},

 abstract = {Virtual reality has become an increasingly familiar part of the science of visualization and communication of information. This, combined with the increase in connectivity of remote sites via high-speed networks, allows for the development of a collaborative distributed virtual environ-ment. Such an environment enables the development of supercomputer simulations with virtual reality visualizations that can be displayed at multiple sites, with each site interacting, viewing, and communicating about the results being discovered.},

 abstract = {This paper discusses the I-WAY project and provides an overview of the papers in this issue of IJSA. The I-WAY is an experimental environment for building distributed virtual reality applications and for exploring issues of distrib uted wide-area resource management and scheduling. The goal of the I-WAY project is to enable researchers to use multiple internetworked supercomputers and ad vanced visualization systems to conduct very large scale computations. By connecting 12 ATM testbeds, 17 supercomputer centers, 5 virtual reality research sites, and over 60 applications groups, the I-WAY project has created an extremely diverse wide-area environment for exploring advanced applications. This environment has provided a glimpse of the future for advanced scientific and engineering computing.},

@inproceedings{CaDiPa96,
 abstract = {Virtual prototyping involves a synthesis of engineering methodology and immersive, three-dimensional visualization technology. Ideally, this is a process in which computational models are used in place of physical models in the development of a new product or design concept. If used successfully, virtual prototyping can lead to more rapid product design and development. Software is currently being developed that will enable virtual prototyping of mechanical systems in the CAVE (CAVE Automatic Virtual Environment) at Argonne National Laboratory. This software has two principal components: (1) fast simulation software, FIFEA (Fast Implicit Finite Element Analysis), for analyzing mechanical systems and (2) virtual reality display software for visualizing results and allowing user interaction. This paper discusses various issues related to the coupling of finite element software to the CAVE display system.},
