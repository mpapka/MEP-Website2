Part of team that won best paper at [2023 IEEE/ACM International Workshop on In Situ Infrastructures for Enabling Extreme-Scale Analysis and Visualization (ISAV)](https://isav-workshop.github.io/2023/). The winning team was led by EVL alumnus and Argonne National Laboratory staff member [Victor A. Mateevitsi](https://www.vmateevitsi.com) and included fellow EVL alumnus [Joe Insley](https://www.alcf.anl.gov/about/people/joseph-insley) and UIC alumnus [Silvio Rizzi](https://www.alcf.anl.gov/about/people/silvio-rizzi). The paper [Scaling Computational Fluid Dynamics: In Situ Visualization of NekRS using SENSEI](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3624062.3624159) explores using in situ analysis and visualization in computational fluid dynamics on leadership-scale computing platforms.
