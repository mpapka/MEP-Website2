#### *Accelerating Scientific Discoveries: Connecting Instruments, Data, and Minds*

**Abstract:** DOE user facilities, such as particle accelerators and light sources, have been vital to U.S. scientific research since the 1950s. Serving thousands of researchers each year, these historically significant facilities have experienced a surge in data production due to technological advances. Computational science, supported by institutions like Argonne National Laboratory and its Leadership Computing Facility (ALCF), has been crucial in driving discoveries across various fields using this data. As next-generation and upgraded DOE facilities generate even more data, integration with HPC resources becomes increasingly essential for continued scientific progress. Building on years of experience, Argonne develops software frameworks and deploys complex computing resources that enable the integration of experimental and computational approaches. The ALCF is evolving to meet the growing demands of data-driven science, promoting collaboration between experimental and computational researchers and leveraging DOE user facilities' unique capabilities. This talk underscores the synergy between DOE user facilities and ASCR computing resources as a critical factor in advancing knowledge and uncovering new scientific opportunities.
