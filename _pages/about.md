I am a professor of <a href= "https://cs.uic.edu">computer science</a> and a member of the <a href= "https://www.evl.uic.edu">Electronic Visualization Laboratory</a>, the <a href="https://spear.lab.uic.edu">SPEAR Lab<a> and Honors College at the <a href= "https://www.cs.uic.edu"> University of Illinois Chicago</a>. I hold a joint appointment with <a href= "https://wwww.anl.gov">Argonne National Laboratory</a>, where I am the deputy associate laboratory director for <a href="https://cels.anl.gov">Computing, Environment and Life Sciences</a>, the director of the <a href= "https://www.alcf.anl.gov">Argonne Leadership Computing Facility</a>, and a senior research scientist. In 2024, I became the founding co-director of the <a href= "https://crabtree.uic.edu">George Crabtree Institute for Discovery and Sustainability</a>. Before UIC, I was the <a href= "https://www.niu.edu/president/professorships/research/past-recipients.shtml">Presidential Research, Scholarship, and Artistry</a> Professor of Computer Science at Northern Illinois University (NIU) where I founded the data, devices, and interaction Laboratory (ddiLab), a joint research lab between NIU's School of Art and the Department of Computer Science. 

I have an M.S. and Ph.D. from [The University of Chicago](https://cs.uchicago.edu), an M.S. from the [University of Illinois Chicago](https://engineering.uic.edu), and a B.S. from [Northern Illinois University](https://www.niu.edu/clas/physics/index.shtml).

My teaching and research interests include high-performance computing, large-scale data analysis, and visualization. Extending from the analysis of output from traditional supercomputers to the data produced by large-scale scientific instruments and sensor networks to the integration of edge and high-performance computing (HPC) across the computing continuum. I'm interested in harnessing operational data to optimize HPC facilities and broadening the use of supercomputers beyond conventional batch computing. This includes a strong interest in enhancing the accessibility of HPC towards fostering real-time interactions and enabling autonomous data generation. I seek to translate complex data into visually compelling results while dedicating my efforts to mentoring the next generation of scientists. These contributions form part of a larger, collective initiative that resonates with my commitment to deepening our understanding of the world by integrating computing with all things.

I invite <a href="mailto:papka@uic.edu?Subject=RA%20Position%20at%20UIC">UIC undergraduate and graduate students</a> to join these efforts and contribute their unique insights and skills to our projects.
